# TrollDumper By BLU3
TrollDumper a custom is a packet analyzer made in python that is launched from the command line. It can be used to analyze network traffic by intercepting and displaying packets that are being created or received by the computer it's running on. It runs on Linux and most UNIX-type operating systems.

# How to use:

apt install curl

apt install tcpdump

apt install nload

chmod +x troll.sh (you can rename later on)

"./troll.sh" Or you can run with "screen ./troll.sh"

(if running with screen do "CTRL A & CTRL D to leave screen while it runs in the background)
